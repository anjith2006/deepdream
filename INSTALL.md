#Installation

NB: Tested only on Ubuntu 14.04.
Modified from the original deepdream code with an additional GUI.

1. Install 'Caffe' as given in: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html

2. Install 'tkinter'

3. Download the files "bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel" and "deploy.prototxt" from the link 'https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_googlenet' and put it in this folder

4. Run the deepdream_gui.py code, select the image file to run from the selection option ( should be '.jpg' or '.jpeg')

5. Wait for sometime, it creates a folder "frame" in which the images generated in each iteration will be stored.

6. You can experiment changing the parameters and models. Enjoy !
