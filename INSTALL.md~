#Installation

NB: Tested only on Ubuntu 14.04.

1. Install Caffe as in (along with all the dependencies): http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html

2. Install tkinter

3. Download the files "bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel" and "deploy.prototxt" from the link  and put it in this folder

4. Run the deepdream_gui.py code, select the image file to run from the selection option ( should be '.jpg' or '.jpeg')

5. Wait for sometime, it creates a folder "frame" in which the images generated will be stored.

6. Change the parameters and models and experiment. Enjoy !
